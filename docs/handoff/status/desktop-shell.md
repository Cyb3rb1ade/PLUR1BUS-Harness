# Desktop shell status

## WP1 — Scaffold, workspace, hygiene, desktop CI

Status: GREEN — draft PR open; root and desktop CI passed at the WP1 head.
Branch: `feat/desktop-shell-wp01-scaffold`.
Base: `origin/main` at `e515dde` (no previous WP).
PR: [#59](https://github.com/Cyb3rb1ade/PLUR1BUS-Harness/pull/59).
Implementation head: `7dd54fed81f2ef1f1857b9f05fe2c921d6ef82e3`.
This follow-up commit records verification only.

### Done and interfaces

- Separate `apps/desktop/Cargo.toml` workspace and lockfile; root excludes `apps`.
- Tauri 2.12.0 / tauri-build 2.7.0 (matching published release); CLI 2.12.0.
- `src-tauri/src/ids.rs`: bundle/keychain/product/container/label/scheme constants.
- One hidden-until-loaded shell window, 800 × 600 minimum, exact CSP, frozen
  prototype, global Tauri off, empty native command capability.
- Static UI build; explicit placeholder SVG and platform icons.
- Source hygiene includes apps; tracked index blobs are scanned for forbidden
  filenames and private key headers without logging contents.
- Five-target CI, exact Action SHAs, unsigned online artifacts retained seven days.
- Development instructions in `docs/desktop.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

### Verification (observed; macOS arm64 unless stated)

- PASS: frozen pnpm install; toolchain check; `pnpm gen`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`.
- PASS: `pnpm test`: 566 passed, 5 skipped (571 total across workspaces).
  Existing skips: three source-filesystem/name/case constraints on this volume;
  two Windows-only icacls tests on macOS. No desktop test skipped.
- PASS: root fmt/Clippy; root Cargo tests: 1006 passed, 1 ignored (the existing
  long-running nightly extension fuzz test; its output explains the opt-in).
- PASS: desktop fmt/locked Clippy/locked Rust tests (8); static UI build/test (1).
- PASS: hygiene self-test (11), including planted tracked p12/OCI files and private
  headers; staged blob scan; `git diff --check`.
- PASS: root Cargo metadata contains only plur1bus, plur1bus-config,
  plur1bus-ext and plur1bus-rpc, with no desktop crate.
- PASS: Tauri debug compile and ad-hoc macOS DMG build; repeated with forwarded
  `-- --locked`. DMG is approximately 2.69 MiB; no notarization was attempted.
- PASS: fresh independent WP1 review found no critical/important bug. Its request
  for explicit locked Tauri builds was incorporated and exercised locally.
- PASS: `desktop.yml` on macos-15, windows-2025, windows-11-arm,
  ubuntu-24.04 and ubuntu-24.04-arm at implementation head `7dd54fe`:
  [PR run](https://github.com/Cyb3rb1ade/PLUR1BUS-Harness/actions/runs/36804333554)
  and [push run](https://github.com/Cyb3rb1ade/PLUR1BUS-Harness/actions/runs/36804288008).
  All five targets produced unsigned preview packages.
- PASS: root unit jobs on macOS/Linux/Windows at `7dd54fe`.
- PASS: root system/service jobs in
  [ci](https://github.com/Cyb3rb1ade/PLUR1BUS-Harness/actions/runs/36804333621).
  The full WP1 root workflow is green.
- PASS: follow-up docs head `1cc0df6`: all five desktop targets in
  [desktop](https://github.com/Cyb3rb1ade/PLUR1BUS-Harness/actions/runs/36805238055),
  and all root jobs in
  [ci attempt 2](https://github.com/Cyb3rb1ade/PLUR1BUS-Harness/actions/runs/36805238108).
  Attempt 1 timed out in the existing importer concurrent-writer SQLite test;
  attempt 2 passed with no root code change.
- PASS: manual packaged-app startup on macOS arm64 with HOME,
  CFFIXED_USER_HOME, XDG config/cache/data and TMPDIR redirected to scratch.
  Native accessibility inspection showed the PLUR1BUS window and HTML container
  at `tauri://localhost`; screenshot showed the expected blank WP1 shell at
  1100 × 800 logical pixels. Empty launch log; Command-Q exited cleanly.
  Screenshot is in the Codex run transcript; no personal data shown.
- Not run: Windows/Linux interactive execution (not available locally).
  No real keychain/service tests or personal home used for the desktop smoke.
- Not applicable: docs:check (no clap/schema/generated-doc inputs changed),
  WP3 a11y/layout, WP14 container e2e, real image pipeline (outside scope).
- Acceptance §8 row 13: desktop matrix PASS (full build/package level); real harness
  image remains out of scope. Interactive startup checked on macOS only.
- Local logs: `/tmp/desktop-wp01-{root,lint,tests,root-rust,rust,clippy,locked-build,locked-bundle,staged-lint}.log`.

### Deviations, defaults and open questions

- Handoff WP branches/draft PRs override older D1 single branch, no-push and
  Claude attribution instructions. No M3 or real image implementation.
- Handoff G-11 puts the Cargo workspace/lockfile at `apps/desktop`, superseding
  the older plan's `src-tauri` workspace. Root pnpm lockfile updated for new importers.
- Node 24.21.0 is provisioned locally through pnpm's package cache; the Linux
  `/home/claude/.node24` path is unavailable on this Mac.
- Engine fetch used a process-scoped HTTPS rewrite after SSH host verification
  failed. No Git config file changed and the engine commit pin is unchanged.
- Icons are synthetic placeholders, permitted by WP1; approved DskIcons exports
  are still required before release.
- Updater artifacts disabled until WP10 introduces placeholder/release key
  validation. Empty image resource glob omitted until resources exist. Otherwise
  unsigned WP1 bundles would require keys or absent files.
- Secret lint exempts only the existing plan's backtick-quoted minisign header
  literal. A regression test rejects an actual header in that same document.
- No application API dependency is installed before a UI consumer needs it.
- UI/a11y/layout frame belongs to WP3; no a11y claim for the WP1 blank window.

### Next

1. WP2: provisional harness contract and isolated mock; no real harness server.

## WP2 — Provisional mock harness, fake binaries and stub image

Status: IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY; controller owns final root and CI gates.
Branch: `feat/desktop-shell-wp02-mock-harness`, base `1cc0df6`.

- `apps/desktop/mock-harness`: in-process `MockHarness::start` control, standalone
  loopback binary, provisional HTTP/SSE/WS session and host-bridge routes,
  hashed persistent device/session state, injected clock and upgrade failure.
- `apps/desktop/test-bins`: real Rust `fake-plur1bus` and `fake-container`
  processes with exact scenario matching, argv recording, fixture documents and
  explicit unknown-command errors. Pair/revoke share the mock's state.
- `apps/desktop/stub-image`: two pinned Docker Hub manifest-list digests,
  non-root read-only test image, opt-in Docker/Podman build and smoke scripts.
  Runtime smoke creates namespaced labeled objects and checks loopback/meta,
  fixture exec and stop time. The controller owns the matching CI workflow edit.
- `pnpm tauri dev` now starts/stops a temporary standalone mock. The empty WP1
  shell has no connection UI yet; WP4 supplies it. The SPA calls `shell_info`
  only when Tauri IPC is exposed; WP5 will add the native command and
  `spa-bridge` capability, so inside-app invocation remains untested in WP2.

### Local verification

- PASS: focused red/green cycles for pairing, fake process scenarios, rate
  limit, event replay/restart, bridge grant and bridge call/result.
- PASS: desktop `cargo test --locked --workspace --no-fail-fast` (WP1 8,
  fake process 4, mock HTTP/WS 16); `cargo clippy --locked --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings`; UI build/test (1); standalone mock meta and
  SIGTERM in 0.002 s; Node script syntax and no-opt-in skip.
- PASS: minimal Docker build-context Cargo metadata and verified builder/runtime
  manifest-list digests via the Docker Hub registry API on 2026-10-01.
- Local container build/run: unavailable; Docker's selected daemon socket is
  absent and Podman is not installed. The opt-in CI smoke must supply actual
  Docker and Podman runtime evidence before the WP2 gate closes.
- Root validation: controller observed frozen install, toolchain check, gen,
  build, lint, Rust fmt/Clippy/tests PASS. First `pnpm test` hit the unchanged
  core import concurrent-writer SQLite `database disk image malformed` test;
  the unchanged targeted retry passed all 10 and the unchanged full retry
  passed. No harness code was changed for it.
- Review note: the fresh task-review agent could not complete because the
  Codex usage limit was reached; the controller performed a read-only review
  of the full WP2 diff and recorded no blocking finding. CI remains the
  authoritative runtime review for Docker and Podman smoke.

### Next

1. Controller runs the real-runtime stub smoke on disposable Docker and Podman CI.
2. Controller completes root test/CI review, then WP3 can start.
